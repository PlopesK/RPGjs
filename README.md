A Pokémon-inspired RPG game project built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! <br>
Dive into a nostalgic 2D adventure made with pure web technologies, no external game engines required!

<h2> 🔎 About the Project 🔎 </h2>
RPGjs is a retro-style top-down RPG game where the player can explore tile-based maps, interact with the environment, and engage in classic turn-based battles! <br> 
This project demonstrates how powerful vanilla web development can be when combined with creativity and a passion for games! <br>
It was designed both as a learning experience and a showcase of what's possible using just the web stack.
